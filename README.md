**A [danger-js](https://danger.systems/js/) plugin to list all todos/fixmes/etc added/changed/removed in a PR.**

*Automating your team's conventions surrounding code review.*
 
This provides another logical step in your process, through which Danger can help lint your rote tasks in daily code review.

You can configure it using a dangerfile, which is a javscript or typescript file in the root of your project. **It'll post it's results as a comment in the PRs of your project.**
